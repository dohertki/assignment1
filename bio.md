This is the bio file.

My name is Kierin Doherty. I grew up in Oregon on our family farm. When I 
finished high school I served in the Coast Guard as an electronic technician. 
I was stationed in California and Alaska. I felt very fortunate getting 
stationed in Alaska. It was a great adventure in some beautiful country. I 
returned home and went to University of Idaho on the G.I. Bill. I received a 
B.S. in Agricultural Economics. I returned to Oregon and have been married 
four years to my wife Ree and we have three children.

I work as a locomotive electrician for Union Pacific Railroad. My 
responsibilities there include  installing Positive Train Control on the 
company's fleet of locomotives. Positive Train Control, or PTC as it is commonly
called, is a federally mandated system to improve the safety of trains. Most 
notably, it prevents collisions between locomotives by taking control of a 
locomotive if it is being operated in an unsafe manner.

During vacations, the family and I like to go camping. We usually plan a
couple big trips each summer.

I started college originally as a plant science major. I took a number of 
courses I really didn't need, but peaked my interest. I took art classes, 
economics classes, computer science classes, and one electrical engineering 
class. I ended up settling on a degree to Ag Econ but remained passionate about 
computers and wizardry that made them work. I thought about pursuing more 
schooling in either electrical engineering or computer science, but there 
are no schools within a reasonable distance from where I live. When I 
discovered that OSU had this program it looked like a good fit for me.
